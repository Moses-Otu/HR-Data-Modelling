# HR-Data-Modelling

In people analytics, a key challenge lies in properly conceptualizing the HR data model. Data is often dispersed across various teams like L&D, compensation, business partnering, exit management, employee engagement, and performance management. Yet, there's often a lack of integration among these teams, hindering analysts from fully leveraging the available data. 
I've developed a pseudo data model in SQL Server to illustrate how an HR model could be structured, drawing on information from different HR units. By establishing these relationships, analysts can delve deeper to uncover valuable insights. 
The essence here isn't just designing the physical ERD but rather conceptualizing entities, identifying relationships, and navigating stakeholder management, data governance, and analyticalÂ skills.
